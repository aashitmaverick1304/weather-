This Weather Web Application is a front-end project built using React. It allows users to search for current weather information for a specific location using a Weather API. This project showcases the usage of React hooks, specifically `useState`, to manage the application's state.

## Features

- **Search by Location:** Users can enter a location (city or zip code) to retrieve the current weather information for that location.

- **Display Weather Data:** The application displays the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon representing the conditions.
